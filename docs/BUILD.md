# Building CBash

Two methods of building CBash are documented:

* [Automated](BUILD.CMAKE.md): Using [CMake](http://cmake.org) to generate a Microsoft Visual C++ solution to build.
* [Manual](BUILD.MANUAL.md): Manually creating a Microsoft Visual C++ solution to build (**NOT RECOMMENDED**). 

The instructions for both methods are tailored to the creation of MSVC 2013 solutions, though the automated method does allow for other build systems and platforms, at the expense of requiring CMake to be installed.

Make sure you have satisfied the dependencies below before following the instructions for either build method.
